# Telco Customer Churn Rate Prediction

## 1. Problem Definition

"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

> Based on the given features of Telco Customer Data, can we predict the customer behaviour & retention of the services (Churn Rate)

## 2. Data & Features

The data consists of 1 target variable (Churn) to predict whether the customer has left within the last month based on the customer behaviour features. The Target variable is a binary and classification problem, with 20 feature variables. The dataset is used from Kaggle dataset called 'Telco Customer Churn' (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). The raw data contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).


The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## 3. Evaluation

> Experimental machine learning project on how customer behaviour affects the rate of customer churn/left the services within the last month

> The target of the customer churn rate approach is to get more than 80% accuracy in order for this project to succeed
